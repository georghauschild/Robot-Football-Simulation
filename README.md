# Robot-Football-Simulation
This project is forked from [magmaoffenburg base code](https://github.com/magmaOffenburg/magmaRelease). It represents a semester project for a Robotics course, with my primary focus on creating dynamic, responsive formations for a soccer robot game. The project serves as an introduction to robotics and the functions described in the readme file reflect only my contribution to the group project.
This project is an extension of the original project by [Magma Offenburg](https://github.com/magmaOffenburg/magmaRelease) and represents a semester-long effort within a robotics course. My main goal of this project was to innovate upon the original design by developing new, responsive formations for soccer robots, which adapt to the ongoing state of the game and implementing a custom goalkeeper. Furthermore, we've also implemented other unique roles, behaviours, animations strategies and architecture changes.
